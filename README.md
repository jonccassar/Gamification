####1. What is Gamification ?####
Gamifcation may be defined as the use of game design elements into a non-gaming environment. With the scope of motivating people, the gamification concept, applies gaming elements like trophies, badges, points, avatars and leader boards to a non-gaming context such as place of work.  Gamification can also be expressed as the utilization of game mechanics, dynamics and framework for the promotion of certain desired audience behaviour. More specifically, gamification can be termed as the utilization of mechanics, feedback loops, loyalty, fun and rewards that server as interaction boosters.

###3. Project Scope
<p>The research question governing this project strives to provide a tangible answer to whether it is possible 
to <u>make the compilation of a dissertation more enjoyable and engaging through gamification to the extent of making 
students wanting to undertake the same process again</u>. In the process, the project strives to shed light on the power of gamification and explain the science, the psychology and the driving forces that are at play in a gamified academic 
process.</p>

###5. Application Features
######5.1 Daily Notifications
* Send notifications every 6 hours - starting at 8.00am 
* LED light flashes 4 times in Magenta colour 
* Mobile vibration 
* Mobile ring tone

######5.2 Schedule
* Connects to gmail calendar and show daily events 
* Indicates total amount of free time less 8 hours of sleep
* Encourages users to work on the dissertation during fee time

######5.3 Points, Badges and Levels
Points can be earned by conducting actions related to production of a dissertation. The application supports three activities from which, points can be earned and these are;
* Reading Papers (15 points)
* Writing dissertation chapters (35%, 80%, 100% completed earn 10, 40 and 50 points)
* Conduct dissertation surveys (5 points)
In the process users can progress through six levels and earn badges assoicated whith each level reached.
