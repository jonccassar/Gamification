Gamification
============

Gamification of the Research Process

####1. Project Scope ####
The purpose of this project is to demonstrate the power of gamification in the research domain. It strives to explain the science, the psychology, the driving forces and the issues involved in the gamification process of an academic environment. 

####2. What is Gamification ?####
Gamifcation may be defined as the use of game design elements into a non-gaming environment. With the scope of motivating people, the gamification concept, applies gaming elements like trophies, badges, points, avatars and leader boards to a non-gaming context such as place of work.  Gamification can also be expressed as the utilization of game mechanics, dynamics and framework for the promotion of certain desired audience behaviour. More specifically, gamification can be termed as the utilization of mechanics, feedback loops, loyalty, fun and rewards that server as interaction boosters.

####3. Example of Existing Systems
#####3.1 Write or Die 2 
Focus on eliminating any writer's block by providing solutions for procrastination and frustration through rewards and penalties. The application provides nice environments which stimulates writing but which disappears if the user stops the writing activity. The penalty section introduces features like visual and hearing stimuli. The user can avoid such stimuli through writing.

#####3.2 750 words 
The application utilises badges and points to encourage users to write approximately three pages of text on a daily basis. As the user advances, the earning of badges increases in difficulty.

######3.3 National Novel Writing Month 
The scope of the National Novel Writing Month (NaNoWriMo) is to help people to stop being afraid of writing long documents.  Instead NaNoWriMo challenges people to write a script of 50,000 words in a period on one month. The quest has been gamified through word counts and progress bars.

#####3.4 Pain Squad App 
Designed around a crime investigation environment, the scope behind Pain Squad Mobile App is to make easy the compilation of pain reports led by sick children. After the completion of three consecutive reports, recruits (users) are informed by the chief (application AI) that they are being promoted to a higher police rank. Messages are not just simple text messages, but videos featuring the cast of Canada's dramas Flashpoint and Rookie Blue.
