</h3>


<p>Gamifcation may be defined as the use of game design elements into a non-gaming environment. 
With the scope of motivating people, the gamification concept, applies gaming elements like trophies, badges, points,
avatars and leader boards to a non-gaming context such as place of work.  Gamification can also be expressed as the 
utilization of game mechanics, dynamics and framework for the promotion of certain desired audience behaviour. More 
specifically, gamification can be termed as the utilization of mechanics, feedback loops, loyalty, fun and rewards 
that server as interaction boosters.</p>

<!--3.1-->
<h6><a name="51-daily-notifications" class="anchor" href="#51-daily-notifications"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>3.1 Research Question</h6>
<p>
The purpose of this study is to analsye whether gamification cause the dissertation process to become more
engaging to the extent of making students want to undertake the same process again.
</p>

<!--3.2-->
<h6><a name="51-daily-notifications" class="anchor" href="#51-daily-notifications"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>3.2 Introduction</h6>

<!--3.3 LITERATURE REVIEW -->
<h6><a name="51-daily-notifications" class="anchor" href="#51-daily-notifications"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>3.3 Literature </h6>
<p>
The study kick start by reviewing an array of literature filed by
game designers, practitioners, academics, game developers and psychologists.
Here Deterding's gamification definition was examined where the term was
unpacked into 4  segments namely <i>Game</i>, <i>Element</i>, <i>Design</i>, and <i>Non-gaming
context</i> and explained independently. 
</p>

<p>
After relaxing the definition, this study reviewed the science and psychology
behind gamification with special emphasis to the FBM model. In conjunction with
the FBM model, The Flow and Bartle's Player model were also discussed.
From this point onwards, literature pertaining to game mechanics, design and
aesthetics was reviewed. Here, arguments related to the MDA framework, points,
levels, leader boards, badges, challenges and on boarding, Gamifcation 1.0 and
smart gamification.
</p>

<p>
The proceeding step in literature looked at existing systems that are close to
this dissertation. System like <i>Write or Die</i>, <i>Epic Win</i>, <i>750 Words</i> and
<i>Pain Squad App</i> were reviewed and documented. The final entry in Chapter 2
reviews criticism filed against gamification with arguments stating that the
term is misleading or that gamification activities put users at the risk of
getting wrapped up in the pointing system.  
</p>

<!--3.4 METHODOLOGY -->
<h6><a name="51-daily-notifications" class="anchor" href="#51-daily-notifications"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>3.4 Methodology</h6>
<P>
The Reviewed literature was used to design a methodology with which the problem
statement could be studied. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hWc0Fd2AS3s">Nielsen's 10 usability heuristics</a>
were briefly reviewed and utilised to build up UML diagrams, mockups designs paper
prototyping. The paper prototype was tested through a pilot study composed of 10
individuals.
</P>

<P>
Feedback from the prototyping was noted and incorporated in the designs. The
chapter proceeded in describing briefly the MoSCoW method and how such method
was used to prioritise the prototype's features. Chapter 4 progressed by listing
the prototype's main features with special emphasis on earning of points from
the conduct of activities, notifications and schedules. Furthermore, the
prototype's mechanics and their implementation through the utilisation of
<i>views</i>, <i>permissions</i>, <i>layouts</i> and other Android's API components was
discussed. The next step in chapter 4 provides a brief account on testing,
deployment, availability of resources and assumption drawn during the
development of the prototype. 
</P>

<p>
As the prototype serves as a data collection tool, Chapter 4 outlines the data
collection methodologies. A pool of 75 full-time students who were currently in
the process of writing a dissertation were randomly chosen from UoM campus.
Subjects were encouraged to test the prototype and to answer to a set of
questions. After a close review of the problem statement, the null and
alternative hypothesis were formed upon which the chi-square test was ran. The
comparing probabilities test was used to check the strength of the results
