        </h3>
<p>
Gamifcation is the use of game design elements in a non-gaming environment. This concept aims to 
motivate subjects through the application of gaming elements, for example trophies, badges, points, 
avatars and leader boards in a non-gaming context such as the place of work.

<!--3.1 RESEARCH QUESTION-->
<h6><a name="51-daily-notifications" class="anchor" href="#51-daily-notifications"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>3.1 Research Question</h6>
<p>
Can the writing process of a dissertation become more enjoyable and engaging through Gamification, to the extent of encouraging students to undertake the same process again in the future?
</p>

<!--3.2 INTRODUCTION -->
<h6><a name="51-daily-notifications" class="anchor" href="#51-daily-notifications"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>3.2 Introduction</h6>
<P>
The objective of this study is to employ Gamifcation in research, with the attempt to make its undertaking more engaging. 
In view of this, this study focused on the dissertation writing process of undergraduate students, through the use of an Android mobile prototype (developed by the researcher) 
which aided in the data collection. Collected data was then utilised for hypotheses testing and the obtained 
results were discussed to form arguments in favour and against Gamifcation.
</P>

<!--3.3 LITERATURE REVIEW -->
<h6><a name="51-daily-notifications" class="anchor" href="#51-daily-notifications"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>3.3 Literature </h6>
<p>
The study kick started through the reviewing of an array of literature filed by game designers, practitioners, academics, game developers and psychologists. 
<a href="http://85.214.46.140/niklas/bach/MindTrek_Gamification_PrinterReady_110806_SDE_accepted_LEN_changes_1.pdf">Deterding's</a> definition of Gamification was examined, where the term was explained in four independent segments: Game, Element, Design and Non-gaming context.
The study then reviewed the science and psychology behind Gamification, with special emphasis on the
<a href="http://bjfogg.com/fbm_files/page4_1.pdf">FBM model</a>. In conjunction with the FBM model,
<a href="http://www.bioenterprise.ca/docs/CREATIVITY-by-Mihaly-Csikszentmihalyi.pdf">The Flow</a> and
<a href="http://mud.co.uk/richard/hcds.htm#rBartle, 1990a">Bartle's Player Model</a> were also discussed. 
From this point onwards, literature pertaining to game mechanics, design and aesthetics was reviewed. 
Here, arguments focused on <a href="http://www.cs.northwestern.edu/~hunicke/MDA.pdf">MDA Framework</a>,
points, levels, leader boards, badges, challenges and on boarding, Gamifcation 1.0 and
Smart Gamification.
</p>

<p>
Literature review then proceeded to look at existing systems that have many aspects that are in 
common with this dissertation, namely Write or Die, Epic Win, 750 Words and Pain Squad App. 
The final entry in Chapter 2 looked at criticism filed against Gamification with arguments 
stating that the term is misleading or that Gamification activities put users at the risk 
of getting forever wrapped up in the 
<a href="http://referaat.cs.utwente.nl/conference/18/paper/7368/targeting-gamification-applications-to-increase-user-participation.pdf">reward loop</a>.
</p>

<!--3.4 METHODOLOGY -->
<h6><a name="51-daily-notifications" class="anchor" href="#51-daily-notifications"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>3.4 Methodology</h6>
<P>
The reviewed literature was used to design a methodology with which the problem statement could be studied.  
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hWc0Fd2AS3s">Nielsen's 10 usability heuristics</a>
were briefly reviewed and utilised to build up UML diagrams, mockup designs and a paper prototype. The paper prototype was 
tested through a pilot study composed of 10 subjects.
</P>

<P>
The feedback obtained from the paper prototype was noted and incorporated in the applicationâ€™s main design. 
This chapter proceeded in describing briefly the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MoSCoW_method">MoSCoW method</a>
and how such a method was used to prioritise the prototype's features. Prioritization was required so as to focus on the main 
components of the application, which are the earning of points from the conduct of dissertation activities such as writing chapters, 
reading papers and conducting surveys. Furthermore, the prototype's mechanics and their implementation through the utilisation of Views, Permissions, 
Layouts and other Android's API components were discussed. 
</P>

<p>
Chapter 4 then provided a brief account on testing, deployment, availability of resources and assumptions drawn during the development of the prototype. 
This chapter also outlined the data collection methodologies, where a pool of 75 full-time 
students who were currently in the process of writing a dissertation, were randomly chosen from University of Malta (UoM) campus. 
Subjects were encouraged to test the prototype and to answer a set of questions. After a close review of the problem statement, 
the null and alternative hypotheses were formed upon which the Chi-Square test was ran. The Comparing Probabilities test was used to check the 
strength of the results.
</p>


<!--3.5-- RESULTS -->
<h6><a name="51-daily-notifications" class="anchor" href="#51-daily-notifications"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>3.5 Results</h6>

<p>
The results section reported the key findings from the employment of the methods discussed in the previous section. 
Firstly, the meta-data was discussed with emphasis on the survey mode, data collection and response. 
Following this, the general descriptive statistics was taken into consideration and this aimed to highlight interesting distributions according to gender. 
Results were presented in two-way contingency tables showing both observed and expected data.
</p>

<p>
The second part discussed the inferential statistics where reference to the null, alternative hypotheses, Goodness of Fit test and Comparing Probabilities was made. 
Here, the p-values and the Chi-Square values obtained from the statistical tests were recorded and analysed. 
This lead to the discussion of the rejection of the null hypothesis, on the basis of the p-values and the Chi-Square values obtained.
</p>

<p>
The last section referred to the Comparing Probabilities tests with the attempt to study the strength of the obtained significance. 
The inferred results provided evidence that the level of significance achieved was not due to chance but because strong ties exist between the research variables. 
This provided the basis for arguments in favour of Gamification within the research process, which were discussed in the next section.
</p>

<!--3.6 COMCLUSION-->
<h6><a name="51-daily-notifications" class="anchor" href="#51-daily-notifications"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>3.6 Conclusion</h6>

<p>
Chapter 5 discussed the results obtained from the gathering of data. 
These findings were compared to either similar findings reported by academics or statistical data compiled by Governmental institutions. 
This section reported that Gamification - implemented as an Android mobile application - succeeded in instigating engagement among the sampled pool. 
This was formally noted through the collected data and informally through the exhilarated behaviour shown by subjects during the hands-on session.
</p>

<p>
Motivation encouraged more students to be willing to undertake the same process again, thus continuing their studies beyond a first degree. 
Engagement and further task repetition rely heavily on the type of rewards used and whether users are motivated by such rewards. 
In Chapter 5, this argument lead to the intrinsic and extrinsic debate, stating that a mixture of both is the optimal solution and 
that this could be included as a potential future project.
</p>

<p>
Other arguments mentioned in Chapter 5 investigated Gamification from the production perspective. 
It was pointed out that in general, Gamification can serve as a production booster and that it can indeed offer a solution for frustration, procrastination and time management. 
Other arguments which were raised, dealt with Gamification as a potential tool for institutions, in particular for universities. 
This argument along with others, formed the basis for potential future studies that could pick up from where this research ended.
