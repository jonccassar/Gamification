        </h3>
<p>
Gamifcation may be defined as the use of game design elements into a non-gaming environment. 
With the scope of motivating people, the Gamification concept, applies gaming elements like trophies, badges, points,
avatars and leader boards to a non-gaming context such as place of work.  Gamification can also be expressed as the 
utilization of game mechanics, dynamics and framework for the promotion of certain desired audience behaviour. More 
specifically, Gamification can be termed as the utilization of mechanics, feedback loops, loyalty, fun and rewards 
that server as interaction boosters.

<!--3.1 RESEARCH QUESTION-->
<h6><a name="51-daily-notifications" class="anchor" href="#51-daily-notifications"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>3.1 Research Question</h6>
<p>
Can the writing of a dissertation be made more enjoyable and engaging through gamifcation to the extent of making students want to undertake the same process again ?
</p>

<!--3.2 INTRODUCTION -->
<h6><a name="51-daily-notifications" class="anchor" href="#51-daily-notifications"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>3.2 Introduction</h6>
<P>
The objective of this study is to employ Gamifcation on a subset of the academic (research)
with the attempt to make the undertaking more engaging. In view of this, this study, focused on the 
dissertation writing process among undergraduate students. Thus, effort was made to gamify the process and to make the process engage 
to the extent of making students want to undertake the same process again. This was done through the development of an
Android mobile application. The application served as a data collection prototype and
the collected data aided in the conduct of hypotheses testing. Results from the hypotheses
were discussed to form arguments in favour or against Gamifcation. The following
sections describe how these aims and objectives were materialise.
</P>

<!--3.3 LITERATURE REVIEW -->
<h6><a name="51-daily-notifications" class="anchor" href="#51-daily-notifications"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>3.3 Literature </h6>
<p>
The study kick started by reviewing an array of literature filed by
game designers, practitioners, academics, game developers and psychologists.
Here, <a href="http://85.214.46.140/niklas/bach/MindTrek_Gamification_PrinterReady_110806_SDE_accepted_LEN_changes_1.pdf">Deterding's</a>
Gamification definition was examined where the term was
unpacked into 4 segments:
<i>Game</i>, 
<i>Element</i>, 
<i>Design</i>, and 
<i>Non-gaming context</i> and explained independently. 
</p>

<p>
After relaxing the Gamification definition, this study reviewed the science and psychology
behind Gamification with special emphasis to the <a href="http://bjfogg.com/fbm_files/page4_1.pdf">FBM model</a>.
In conjunction with the FBM Model, <a href="http://www.bioenterprise.ca/docs/CREATIVITY-by-Mihaly-Csikszentmihalyi.pdf">The Flow</a> and 
 <a href="http://mud.co.uk/richard/hcds.htm#rBartle, 1990a">Bartle's Player Model</a> were also discussed.
From this point onwards, literature pertaining to game mechanics, design and aesthetics 
was reviewed. Here, arguments related to the <a href="http://www.cs.northwestern.edu/~hunicke/MDA.pdf">MDA Framework</a>, points,
levels, leader boards, badges, challenges and on boarding, Gamifcation 1.0 and
Smart Gamification.
</p>

<p>
The proceeding step in literature looked at existing systems that are close to
this dissertation. System like <i>Write or Die</i>, <i>Epic Win</i>, <i>750 Words</i> and
<i>Pain Squad App</i> were reviewed and documented. The final entry in Chapter 2
reviews criticism filed against Gamification with arguments stating that the
term is misleading or that Gamification activities put users at the risk of
getting wrapped up in the reward loop forever.  
</p>

<!--3.4 METHODOLOGY -->
<h6><a name="51-daily-notifications" class="anchor" href="#51-daily-notifications"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>3.4 Methodology</h6>
<P>
The reviewed literature was used to design a methodology with which the problem
statement could be studied. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hWc0Fd2AS3s">Nielsen's 10 usability heuristics</a>
were briefly reviewed and utilised to build up UML diagrams, mockups designs and a paper
prototype. The paper prototype was tested through a pilot study composed of 10
subjects.
</P>

<P>
Feedback from the prototyping was noted and incorporated in the application main design. The
Chapter proceeded in describing briefly the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MoSCoW_method">MoSCoW method</a>
and how such method was used to prioritise the prototype's features. Chapter 4 progressed by listing
the prototype's main features with special emphasis on earning of points from
the conduct of activities, notifications and schedules. Furthermore, the
prototype's mechanics and their implementation through the utilisation of
<i>Views</i>, 
<i>Permissions</i>, 
<i>Layouts</i>
and other Android's API components were discussed. The next step in Chapter 4 provided a brief account on testing,
deployment, availability of resources and assumption drawn during the
development of the prototype. 
</P>

<p>
As the prototype served as a data collection tool, Chapter 4 outlines the data
collection methodologies. A pool of 75 full-time students who were currently in
the process of writing a dissertation were randomly chosen from University of Malta(UoM) campus.
Subjects were encouraged to test the prototype and to answer to a set of
questions. After a close review of the problem statement, the null and
alternative hypotheses were formed upon which the Chi-Square test was ran. The
Comparing Probabilities test was used to check the strength of the results
</p>


<!--3.5-- RESULTS -->
<h6><a name="51-daily-notifications" class="anchor" href="#51-daily-notifications"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>3.5 Results</h6>

<p>
Results section reports the key findings from the employment of
the methods discussed in the previous section. Discussed firstly is the 
meta-data with emphasis on the survey mode, data collection and response. Following, is 
discussed the general descriptive statistics which aimed to 
highlight interesting distributions according to gender. Results are
presented in two-way contingency tables showing both observed and expected
data.
</p>

<p>
The second part discussed the inferential statistics
where reference to the null, alternative hypotheses, Goodness of Fit test and
Comparing Probabilities was made. Here the p-values and the Chi-Square values
obtained from the statistical tests were recorded and analysed. This lead to the
discussion of the rejection of the null hypothesis on the bases of the p-values
and the Chi-Square values obtained. 
</p>

<p>
The last section made use of the Comparing Probabilities
tests with the attempt to study the strength of the obtained significance. The
inferred results provided evidence that the level of significance achieved is
not due to chance but because strong ties exist between the research variables.
This provided the basis for arguments in favour of Gamification and the research process which
were discussed in the next section.
</p>

<!--3.6 COMCLUSION-->
<h6><a name="51-daily-notifications" class="anchor" href="#51-daily-notifications"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>3.6 Conclusion</h6>

<p>
In final, Chapter 5 discussed interesting results obtained from the gathering
of data. These findings were compared to either similar findings
reported by academics or statistical data compiled by Governmental institutions.
This section reported that Gamification (implemented as an Android mobile
application) succeeded in instigating engagement among the sampled pool.
This was formally noted through the collected data and informally through the
exhilarated behaviour shown by subjects during the hands on session.
</p>

<p>
Motivation encouraged more students to be willing to undertake
the same process again, thus continue their studies beyond a first degree. Engagement and
further more task repetition rely heavily on the type of rewards used and
whether users are motivated by such rewards. In Chapter 5 this argument lead to
the intrinsic and extrinsic debate and which, among the two is best to use in a
gamified application. The argument advanced by stating that a mixture of both is
the optimal solution and that this could be included as a potential future project.
</p>

<p>
Other arguments mentioned in Chapter 5 investigated Gamification from the
production perspective. Here, it was mentioned that in general, Gamification can
serve as a production booster and that Gamification can indeed offer a solution
for frustration, procrastination and time management. Other arguments raised
dealt with Gamification as a potential tool for the institution in particular for
Universities. This argument along with others set the basis for potential future
work that could pick up from where this study ended.
