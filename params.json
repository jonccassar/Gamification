What is Gamification ?\r\n</h3>\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Gamifcation may be defined as the use of game design elements into a non-gaming environment. \r\nWith the scope of motivating people, the gamification concept, applies gaming elements like trophies, badges, points,\r\navatars and leader boards to a non-gaming context such as place of work.  Gamification can also be expressed as the \r\nutilization of game mechanics, dynamics and framework for the promotion of certain desired audience behaviour. More \r\nspecifically, gamification can be termed as the utilization of mechanics, feedback loops, loyalty, fun and rewards \r\nthat server as interaction boosters.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>\r\n<a name=\"2-example-of-existing-systems\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"#2-example-of-existing-systems\"><span class=\"octicon octicon-link\"></span></a>2.

In view of this, this study,\r\nfocuses on the dissertation writing process among undergraduate students. Thus, effort\r\nwill be made to gamify the process and make it engage to the extend of making students\r\nwant to undertake the same process again. This will be done through the development of an\r\nAndroid mobile application. The application will server as a data collection prototype and\r\nthe collected data will aid in conducting hypothesis testing. Results from the hypothesis\r\nwill be discussed to form arguments in favour or against gami\fcation. The following\r\nsection describes how these aims and objects are to materialise.\r\n</P>\r\n\r\n<!--3.3 LITERATURE REVIEW -->\r\n<h6><a name=\"51-daily-notifications\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"#51-daily-notifications\"><span class=\"octicon octicon-link\"></span></a>3.3 Literature </h6>\r\n<p>\r\nThe study kick start by reviewing an array of literature filed by\r\ngame designers, practitioners, academics, game developers and psychologists.\r\nHere <a href=\"http://85.214.46.140/niklas/bach/MindTrek_Gamification_PrinterReady_110806_SDE_accepted_LEN_changes_1.pdf\">Deterding's</a>\r\ngamification definition was examined where the term was\r\nunpacked into 4  segments namely <i>Game</i>, <i>Element</i>, <i>Design</i>, and <i>Non-gaming\r\ncontext</i> and explained independently. \r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nAfter relaxing the definition, this study reviewed the science and psychology\r\nbehind gamification with special emphasis to the <a href=\"http://bjfogg.com/fbm_files/page4_1.pdf\">FBM model</a>.\r\nIn conjunction with the FBM model, <a href=\"http://www.bioenterprise.ca/docs/CREATIVITY-by-Mihaly-Csikszentmihalyi.pdf\">The Flow</a> and \r\n<a href=\"http://mud.co.uk/richard/hcds.htm#rBartle, 1990a\">Bartle's Player model</a> were also discussed.\r\nFrom this point onwards, literature pertaining to game mechanics, design and\r\naesthetics was reviewed. Here, arguments related to the <a href=\"http://www.cs.northwestern.edu/~hunicke/MDA.pdf\">MDA framework</a>, points,\r\nlevels, leader boards, badges, challenges and on boarding, Gamifcation 1.0 and\r\nSmart gamification.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nThe proceeding step in literature looked at existing systems that are close to\r\nthis dissertation. System like <i>Write or Die</i>, <i>Epic Win</i>, <i>750 Words</i> and\r\n<i>Pain Squad App</i> were reviewed and documented. The final entry in Chapter 2\r\nreviews criticism filed against gamification with arguments stating that the\r\nterm is misleading or that gamification activities put users at the risk of\r\ngetting wrapped up in the pointing system.  \r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<!--3.4 METHODOLOGY -->\r\n<h6><a name=\"51-daily-notifications\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"#51-daily-notifications\"><span class=\"octicon octicon-link\"></span></a>3.4 Methodology</h6>\r\n<P>\r\nThe Reviewed literature was used to design a methodology with which the problem\r\nstatement could be studied. <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hWc0Fd2AS3s\">Nielsen's 10 usability heuristics</a>\r\nwere briefly reviewed and utilised to build up UML diagrams, mockups designs paper\r\nprototyping. The paper prototype was tested through a pilot study composed of 10\r\nsubjects.\r\n</P>\r\n\r\n<P>\r\nFeedback from the prototyping was noted and incorporated in the designs. The\r\nchapter proceeded in describing briefly the \r\n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MoSCoW_method\">MoSCoW method</a>\r\nand how such method was used to prioritise the prototype's features. Chapter 4 progressed by listing\r\nthe prototype's main features with special emphasis on earning of points from\r\nthe conduct of activities, notifications and schedules. Furthermore, the\r\nprototype's mechanics and their implementation through the utilisation of\r\n<i>views</i>, <i>permissions</i>, <i>layouts</i> and other Android's API components was\r\ndiscussed. The next step in chapter 4 provides a brief account on testing,\r\ndeployment, availability of resources and assumption drawn during the\r\ndevelopment of the prototype. \r\n</P>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nAs the prototype serves as a data collection tool, Chapter 4 outlines the data\r\ncollection methodologies. A pool of 75 full-time students who were currently in\r\nthe process of writing a dissertation were randomly chosen from UoM campus.\r\nSubjects were encouraged to test the prototype and to answer to a set of\r\nquestions. After a close review of the problem statement, the null and\r\nalternative hypothesis were formed upon which the chi-square test was ran. The\r\ncomparing probabilities test was used to check the strength of the results\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<!--3.5-- RESULTS -->\r\n<h6><a name=\"51-daily-notifications\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"#51-daily-notifications\"><span class=\"octicon octicon-link\"></span></a>3.5 Results</h6>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nResults report the key findings from the employment of\r\nthe methods discussed in the previous section. Discussed firstly is the \r\nmeta-data with emphasis on the survey mode, data collection and response.\r\nFollowing, is discussed the general descriptive statistics which aimed in \r\nhighlighting interesting distributions according to gender. Results are\r\npresented in a two-way contingency tables showing both observed and expected\r\ndata.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nThe second part discussed the inferential statistics\r\nwhere reference to the null, alternative hypothesis, Goodness of Fit test and\r\ncomparing probabilities is made. Here the p-values and the chi-square values\r\nobtained from the statistical tests are recorded and analysed. This leads to the\r\ndiscussion of the rejection of the null hypothesis on the bases of the p-values\r\nand the chi-square values obtained. \r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nThe last section make use of the Comparing Proportions\r\ntests with the attempt to study the strength of the obtained significance. The\r\ninferred results provided evidence that the level of significance achieved is\r\nnot due to chance but because strong ties exist between the research variables.\r\nThis provided arguments in favour of gamification and the research process which\r\nwere then discussed in the next section.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<!--3.6 COMCLUSION-->\r\n<h6><a name=\"51-daily-notifications\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"#51-daily-notifications\"><span class=\"octicon octicon-link\"></span></a>3.6 Conclusion</h6>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nIn final, Chapter 5 discussed interesting results obtained from the gathering\r\nof data. These findings were compared to either similar findings\r\nreported by academics or statistical data compiled by Governmental institutions.\r\nThis section reports that gamification (implemented as an Android mobile\r\napplication) succeeded in instigating engagement among the sampled pool.\r\nThis was formally noted through the collected data and informally through the\r\nexhilarated behaviour shown by subjects during the hands on session.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nMotivation encouraged more students to be willing to undertake\r\nthe same process again, thus continue their studies beyond a first degree. Engagement and\r\nfurther more task repetition rely heavily on the type of rewards used and\r\nwhether users are motivated by such rewards. In chapter 5 this argument lead to\r\nthe intrinsic and extrinsic debate and which among the two is best to use in a\r\ngamified application. The argument advanced by stating that a mixture of both is\r\nthe optimal solution and that this could be included as a potential future project.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nOther arguments mentioned in Chapter 5 investigated gamification from the\r\nproduction perspective. Here it was mentioned that in general, gamification can\r\nserve as a production booster and that gamification can indeed offer a solution\r\nfor frustration, procrastination and time management. Other arguments raised\r\ndealt with gamification as a tool the institution in particular for\r\nuniversities. This argument along with others set the basis for potential future\r\nwork that could pick up from were this study ended.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<!-- Application Features -->\r\n<h3><a name=\"5-application-features\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"#5-application-features\"><span class=\"octicon octicon-link\"></span></a>4.
