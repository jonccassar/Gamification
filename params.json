What is Gamification ?####\r\nGamifcation may be defined as the use of game design elements into a non-gaming environment. With the scope of motivating people, the gamification concept, applies gaming elements like trophies, badges, points, avatars and leader boards to a non-gaming context such as place of work.  Gamification can also be expressed as the utilization of game mechanics, dynamics and framework for the promotion of certain desired audience behaviour. More specifically, gamification can be termed as the utilization of mechanics, feedback loops, loyalty, fun and rewards that server as interaction boosters.\r\n\r\n####2.
