Gamification has been proven to enhance communication and collaboration, drive
participation and increase engagement across multiple audiences within multiple
industries. From entertainment to software and retail to manufacturing, companies are
shaping the behaviors of their customers, employees, partners and communities by
applying game mechanics to a variety of experiences. But perhaps no industry is better
suited to reap the benefits of gamification than healthcare.
While adoption is still in its infancy, several healthcare companies on the cutting edge of
technology are rapidly moving forward with efforts to implement gamification strategies
—and for good reason: Early results signal a deeply profound and long-term impact
on patients, doctors and even administrative staff. With gamification, patients can be
encouraged to improve eating and exercise habits, doctors can engage and collaborate
more effectively, and administrative professionals can increase performance and
customer service levels, all resulting in a positive influence across the industry.
