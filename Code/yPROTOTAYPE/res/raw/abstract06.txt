Gamification is the "use of game design elements in non-game contexts"
(Deterding et al, 2011, p.1). A frequently used model for gamification is to equate an
activity in the non-game context with points and have external rewards for reaching
specified point thresholds. One significant problem with this model of gamification is that
it can reduce the internal motivation that the user has for the activity, as it replaces
internal motivation with external motivation. If, however, the game design elements can
be made meaningful to the user through information, then internal motivation can be
improved as there is less need to emphasize external rewards. This paper introduces the
concept of meaningful gamification through a user-centered exploration of theories
behind organismic integration theory, situational relevance, situated motivational
affordance, universal design for learning, and player-generated content.
