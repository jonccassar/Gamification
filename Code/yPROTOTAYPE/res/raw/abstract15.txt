In this paper we present the MDA framework (standing for
Mechanics, Dynamics, and Aesthetics), developed and
taught as part of the Game Design and Tuning Workshop at
the Game Developers Conference, San Jose 2001-2004.
MDA is a formal approach to understanding games ? one
which attempts to bridge the gap between game design and
development, game criticism, and technical game research.
We believe this methodology will clarify and strengthen the
iterative processes of developers, scholars and researchers
alike, making it easier for all parties to decompose, study
and design a broad class of game designs and game
artifacts.
