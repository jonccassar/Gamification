The current psychological research literature surrounding serious games tends to
focus on immersive environments where parts of the “real world” are recreated.
Military videogames, for example, are most typically 3D-rendered environments
where teammates perform cooperative tasks, from basic drill exercises to complex
collaborative missions (e.g. Orvis et al., 2009). The purpose of immersion in such
games is certainly clear; a real in-person environment must be recreated, with all
the complexities of the technical and social interactions typically found there. This
specific kind of game, called a simulation game, maximizes the fidelity of the learning
environment so that it more completely represents the real world, combining
elements of both games and simulations (Wilson et al., 2008). This is certainly a
valuable application of videogaming. But this use is
