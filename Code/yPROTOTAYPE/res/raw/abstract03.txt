The adoption of software engineering practices
cannot always be achieved by education or processes. However,
social software has the potential for supporting deliberate
behavior change. We present preliminary results of an
experiment in which we encouraged computer science students
to make more frequent commits to version control by using a
social software application. We provided a web-based
newsfeed of commits that also displayed a leaderboard. While
we have yet to analyze the data, interviews we conducted with
the participants allow for first qualitative insights.
