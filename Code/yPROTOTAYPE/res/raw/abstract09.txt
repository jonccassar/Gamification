Recent years have seen a rapid proliferation of mass-market
consumer software that takes inspiration from video games.
Usually summarized as “gamification”, this trend connects to a
sizeable body of existing concepts and research in humancomputer
interaction and game studies, such as serious games,
pervasive games, alternate reality games, or playful design.
However, it is not clear how “gamification” relates to these,
whether it denotes a novel phenomenon, and how to define it.
Thus, in this paper we investigate “gamification” and the
historical origins of the term in relation to precursors and similar
concepts. It is suggested that “gamified” applications provide
insight into novel, gameful phenomena complementary to playful
phenomena. Based on our research, we propose a definition of
“gamification” as the use of game design elements in non-game
contexts.
