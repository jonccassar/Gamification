As video games, particularly, social games are growing in popularity and number of users, there has been
an increasing interest in its potential as innovative teaching tools. Gamification is a new concept intending
to use elements from video games in non-game applications. Education is an area with high potential
for application of this concept since it seeks to promote people’s motivation and engagement. The
research in progress will try to find how to apply social gamification in education, testing and validating
the results of that application. To fulfil these objectives, this paper presents the guidelines and main features
of a social gamification framework to be applied in an existent K-6 social learning environment.
