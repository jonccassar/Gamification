With smart phone in hand, enabled patients are looking for ways to interact with and improve their
health using mobile technology. This is resulting in demands for easier access to healthcare
professionals, access to online medical information, and alternatives to contain costs and improve
the quality of care. Unfortunately, many healthcare organizations are still utilizing a “one size fits
all” approach to medicine. In this age of mass customization, this quickly translates into “one size
fits none” healthcare since these initiatives almost never meet all of the individual needs of today’s
enabled patient. Gamified healthcare is an excellent alternative to help healthcare organizations
engage patients in their care and, surprisingly, invest in better outcomes as a result.
