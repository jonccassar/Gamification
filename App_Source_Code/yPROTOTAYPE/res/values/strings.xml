    <string name="abstract1">Gamification, the use of game mechanics in non-gaming
applications, has been applied to various systems to
encourage desired user behaviors. In this paper, we examine
patterns of user activity in an enterprise social network
service after the removal of a points-based incentive
system. Our results reveal that the removal of the incentive
scheme did reduce overall participation via contribution
within the SNS. We also describe the strategies by point
leaders and observe that users geographically distant from
headquarters tended to comment on profiles outside of their
home country. Finally, we describe the implications of the
removal of extrinsic rewards, such as points and badges, on
social software</string>
