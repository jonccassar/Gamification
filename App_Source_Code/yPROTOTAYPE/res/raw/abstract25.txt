 The implementation of game mechanics (like points or leadersboards) in a 
serious context is called “gamification”. In this explorative analysis of a single case 
participants of an online idea competition were asked about their motives for 
participation, flow, enjoyment, task involvement and their perception of game 
mechanics with respect to flow, enjoyment and task involvement. The results indicate 
that game mechanics may be a solution to address the main challenges of online idea 
competitions. However, the analyzed case illustrates also that if game mechanics are 
applied inadequately and unsophisticatedly they are not able to unfold their potential.
