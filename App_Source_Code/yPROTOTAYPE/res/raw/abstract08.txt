Gamification refers to the application of game dynamics,
mechanics, and frameworks into non-game settings. Many
educators have attempted, with varying degrees of success,
to effectively utilize game dynamics to increase student
motivation and achievement in the classroom. In an effort
to better understand how gamification can effectively be
utilized to this end, presented here is a review of existing
literature on the subject as well as a case study on three
different applications of gamification in the post-secondary
setting. This analysis reveals that the underlying dynamics
that make games engaging are largely already recognized
and utilized in modern pedagogical practices, although
under different designations. This provides some legitimacy
to a practice that is sometimes dismissed as superficial, and
also provides a way of formulating useful guidelines for
those wishing to utilize the power of games to motivate
student achievement.
