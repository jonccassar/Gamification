Adding game elements to an application to motivate use
and enhance the user experience is a growing trend
known as gamification. This study explores the use of
game achievements when applied to a mobile application
designed to help new students at university. This paper
describes the foundations of a design framework used to
integrate game elements to Orientation Passport, a
personalised orientation event application for smart
phones. Orientation Passport utilises game achievements
to present orientation information in an engaging way and
to encourage use of the application. The system is
explained in terms of the design framework, and the
findings of a pilot study involving 26 new students are
presented. This study contributes the foundations of a
design framework for general gamified achievement
design. It also suggests that added game elements can be
enjoyable but can potentially encourage undesirable use
by some, and aren’t as enjoyable if not enforced properly
by the technology. Consideration is also needed when
enforcing stricter game rules as usability can be affected.
