Gamification is the concept of applying the mechanics of gaming to nongame activities to
change people’s behaviour (Gamification.org, 2012). The goal with gamification is to drive
a specific behaviour and motivate the users of a gamified system1. This thesis describes
gamification on a detailed level in order to clarify what gamification is and how it works,
both in theory and in practice. Furthermore, a proposal on how to take gamification to the
next level is presented as a part of the thesis.
