Gamification. Maybe you’ve heard of it. It’s the
new term invented to describe the application
of game mechanics such as points, badges, and
levels to non-game processes. Your first introduction
to gamification may have been through
a location-based check-in service like foursquare. Check in
at the local Starbucks often enough and you get a Starbucks
badge. Check in more than anyone else and you get to be mayor
of your favorite local java joint. Though mobile devices and
downloadable applications may have expanded the market for
gamified systems, they’re nothing new. Accumulating airline
miles, earning frequent-shopper discounts, and even increasing
gas mileage through the use of the gas efficiency gauge on
a hybrid car are all, somewhat, games. Gamification is an effort
to gain points and status for completing tasks. It may be the new
hot thing to marketers, but to those of us in academia, these
systems should seem familiar.
