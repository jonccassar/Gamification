Recently digital designers have begun to integrate game el-
ements and mechanics into non-game applications, systems,
and services, to better engage end-users. This notion is
named as the \gamication". In this paper, we discuss the
idea of applying the gamication concept in designing intel-
ligent environments to improve the overall user engagement.
We present two case studies to better understand the eec-
tiveness of gamifying intelligent systems: a mobile crowd-
sourcing application that works as image based social search
across languages, called UbiAsk, and a persuasive applica-
tion for motivating users to reduce CO2 emissions named
EcoIsland. We argue that the game-based incentive meth-
ods only work with a careful design: designers should be
aware that the main functionalities of the system have much
greater impact than the additional gamied components,
and the desired game-like user behavior requires compre-
hensive game-like experience that is supported by not
