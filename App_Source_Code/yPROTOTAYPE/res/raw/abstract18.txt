“Gamification” is an informal umbrella term for the use 
of video game elements in non-gaming systems to 
improve user experience (UX) and user engagement. 
The introduction of ‘gamified’ applications to large 
audiences promises new additions to the existing rich 
and diverse research on the heuristics, design patterns 
and dynamics of games and game-based systems the 
positive UX they provide. However, what is lacking for a 
next step forward is the integration of these diverse 
research endeavors. Therefore, this one-day workshop 
brings together researchers and practitioners to 
develop a shared understanding of existing approaches 
and findings around the gamification of information 
systems, and identify key synergies, opportunities, and 
questions for future research.
