To create more emotion in innovative future games, we at XEODesign want to know more
about the role of emotion in games and identify ways to create emotion other than story cutscenes.
In improving over 40 million Player Experiences during twelve years of research and
design we have seen people get angry, excited, and on occasion even cry. These reactions
make us wonder how many emotions do games create? What makes failing 80% of the time
fun? Do people play to feel emotions as well as challenge? If emotions are important to play,
where do they come from? Do people modify games to feel differently? Is it possible to build
emotions into games by adding emotion-producing objects or actions to game play rather than
cut scenes? To what extent are game developers already doing this?
