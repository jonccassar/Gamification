00:00:16,129 --> 00:00:21,310
Welcome to this video. My name is Jonathan
Cassar and in this video I will be showing

2
00:00:21,310 --> 00:00:27,070
how to use the application named Gamification
Research. The application is uploaded on the

3
00:00:27,070 --> 00:00:31,460
Google Play store and a link can be found
in the description below.

4
00:00:31,460 --> 00:00:37,860
Click the blue icon with the white star. The
main menu will appear. Here, the system shows

5
00:00:37,860 --> 00:00:43,970
the total points, daily points and the days
elapsed. Underneath the buttons, the system

6
00:00:43,970 --> 00:00:49,409
shows the level reached, badges earned and
the process achieved.

7
00:00:49,409 --> 00:00:54,839
Before exploring further the application,
a number of parameters, must be inputted into

8
00:00:54,839 --> 00:01:00,710
the system so that the application could function
appropriately. These parameters can be inputted

9
00:01:00,710 --> 00:01:06,220
into the system through the settings screen
found in the top right corner.

10
00:01:06,220 --> 00:01:13,220
Inside the setting screen, enter a user name
and an email address. Progress by enter the

11
00:01:48,990 --> 00:01:55,990
dissertation length. In this case it is assumed
to be 15,000. Enter the introduction length

12
00:01:57,009 --> 00:02:04,009
as a percentage of the total length e.g. 25%.
Do the same for the literature review (25%),

13
00:02:05,249 --> 00:02:12,249
methodology (20%), results (25%) and finally
conclusion (15%). Progress by enter the number

14
00:02:23,380 --> 00:02:30,380
of surveys to be conducted. In this case 200
surveys are to be conducted. Continue by enter

15
00:02:32,550 --> 00:02:39,550
the starting date of the dissertation e.g.
1st September 2013.

16
00:02:43,720 --> 00:02:50,290
The Notifications if ticked, will send notifications
every 6 hours starting at eight in the morning.

17
00:02:50,290 --> 00:02:56,470
The Reset daily points if ticked, will reset
the daily points. The Reset if ticked, will

18
00:02:56,470 --> 00:03:01,900
reset all data stored in the application.
Back to the main menu, the system will now

19
00:03:01,900 --> 00:03:07,900
reflect the inputted data. Now that the system
is set up, actions can be conducted to earn

20
00:03:07,900 --> 00:03:14,380
points, level-up and earn badges. Actions
consist of reading papers, writing chapters

21
00:03:14,380 --> 00:03:20,160
and conducting surveys.
Let's start by exploring the paper's section.

22
00:03:20,160 --> 00:03:25,840
Click the paper's button to enter the paper's
section. Here, 15 points can be earned with

23
00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:32,180
every read performed. Click on the orange
buttons, e.g. paper 1 to display the paper's

24
00:03:32,180 --> 00:03:37,500
abstract. Read through the physical paper
and once ready hit the Read button to earn

25
00:03:37,500 --> 00:03:44,500
15 points. Note how the button changed from
orange to green to mark a state of completion.

26
00:03:45,830 --> 00:03:50,900
Navigating back to the main menu, it can be
seen how the total and daily points increased

27
00:03:50,900 --> 00:03:56,310
to reflect the points earned. Back to the
Papers Progress Screen, if the wrong button

28
00:03:56,310 --> 00:04:03,070
has been clicked by mistake, the action can
be reverted. Say paper 3 was wrongly clicked,

29
00:04:03,070 --> 00:04:09,150
click the green icon again and the original
sate of the button will be restored.

30
00:04:09,150 --> 00:04:13,000
Click the blue icon with the question mark
symbol found in the bottom right hand corner

31
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:20,000
of the screen. The popup window provides hints
and actions that can be performed.

32
00:04:26,180 --> 00:04:33,180
Now Let's explore the points earn from writing.
From the main menu, click the Progress button.

33
00:04:33,500 --> 00:04:40,500
The Introduction, Literature Review, Methodology,
Results and Conclusion are displayed. The

34
00:04:41,150 --> 00:04:45,350
numbers in brackets show the amount of words
to be written for each chapter to be considered

35
00:04:45,350 --> 00:04:51,150
as completed. To the left of the progress
bar, buttons in red colour are displayed.

36
00:04:51,150 --> 00:04:57,090
These buttons, change colour according to
the level of completeness. Red indicates a

37
00:04:57,090 --> 00:05:04,090
low level of completeness. Yellow indicates
half way through. Green indicates almost completeness.

38
00:05:05,060 --> 00:05:08,900
Click the blue icon with the question mark
symbol found in the bottom right hand corner

39
00:05:08,900 --> 00:05:15,900
of the screen. The popup window provides hints
and actions that can be performed.

40
00:05:17,030 --> 00:05:22,130
Points are earned by writing the dissertation
report. The more written text, the higher

41
00:05:22,130 --> 00:05:23,910
the points earned. If for example 1000 words
from the Introduction chapter are written,

42
00:05:23,910 --> 00:05:30,910
points can be earned by sliding the slider
to the left. This increases the word count

43
00:05:31,660 --> 00:05:36,990
found beneath the slider and changes the colour
of the buttons. Navigating back to the main

44
00:05:36,990 --> 00:05:43,990
menu, it can be seen how the total and daily
points increased to reflect the points earned.

45
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:52,060
Now Let's explore the Evaluation.
Click the Evaluation screen to display the

46
00:05:52,060 --> 00:05:59,060
Evaluation Progress. Here, points are earned
by completing surveys. With each survey completed,

47
00:05:59,910 --> 00:06:04,930
2 points will be earned. The total number
of surveys which needs to be completed are

48
00:06:04,930 --> 00:06:10,710
displayed at the bottom of the screen. Beneath,
are the daily points earned from surveys along

49
00:06:10,710 --> 00:06:15,860
with some hints. Hints change according to
the number of surveys completed and provide

50
00:06:15,860 --> 00:06:20,180
guidelines on how the response can be further
increased.

51
00:06:20,180 --> 00:06:25,230
If for example 20 surveys have been conducted,
rotating the wheel in a clockwise fashion

52
00:06:25,230 --> 00:06:30,530
will change the progress bar colour from dark
red to light green. The number of completed

53
00:06:30,530 --> 00:06:37,530
survey at the centre of the wheel increases
to mark the progress.

54
00:06:37,919 --> 00:06:41,790
Click the blue icon with the question mark
symbol found on the bottom right hand corner

55
00:06:41,790 --> 00:06:48,790
of the screen. The popup window provides hints
and actions that can be performed.

56
00:06:54,760 --> 00:07:01,120
Finally let's explore the Calendar
No points can be earned here. The purpose

57
00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:06,310
of this section is to display the daily events
entered through the gmail calendar. Given

58
00:07:06,310 --> 00:07:11,220
the daily commitments and 8 hours of sleep,
the application suggests the time available

59
00:07:11,220 --> 00:07:18,220
to work on the dissertation. No excused to
procrastinate.

60
00:07:22,990 --> 00:07:27,110
To Recap
The purpose of the application is to gamify

61
00:07:27,110 --> 00:07:33,180
the dissertation writing process. Points,
badges and levelling up can be earned by reading

62
00:07:33,180 --> 00:07:40,180
papers, writing text and conduct surveys.
I hope this was informative for you, and I

63
00:07:55,669 --> 00:07:57,470
would like to thank you for viewing.
